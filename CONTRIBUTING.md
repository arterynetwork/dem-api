Please be sure to read the following before making or requesting a change.

## Reporting Issues

We do not provide help with configuration issues, using JavaScript, general programming questions and so on. You can try
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or [Google](https://www.google.com/) if you have encountered one. Thank you
for respecting our time.

If you believe you really see a bug in our code, please look through open issues first. Maybe it's already reported.

Finally, if you're reporting a bug, please state these significant points:

 - Why you believe it's a problem? What kind of bad things might happen due to the issue?
 - How to reproduce the issue? We'd be happy to see a working code sample.
 - Do you have any thoughts how it can be fixed? A pull request would be great, but any idea might help.

## Contributing Code

Your PRs are welcome. But in prior to send one please make you sure that:

 - `npm run lint` doesn't find any errors or formatting issues.
 - `npm test` passes.
 - All new code is covered by unit test.
 - New code makes sense.

## Why all the code has the same author

The Artery Team is developing in private repositories. When release is ready and tested we publish it here
by a single commit from the company account.
